# Welcome to GleanEasy!
Hello everyone, Earth Day Canada Group 15 is happy to demonstrate GleanEasy, the gleaning management application of the future! Below, you can find our team composition, as well as everybody's roles. A link to the domain model and project requirements, which can be found in the project wiki, can also be found at the bottom of the page. 

## Scope of the Project
The goal of the project is to design a web applicaiton that will faciliate the management of gleaning events across Canada. The application will host services for the producer, volunteer, and food bank organization, all parties who are vital to successful gleaning. The website will be useful for publicising, finding, and volunteering for events, as well as allowing food banks to register their harvest for pickup or delivery.
